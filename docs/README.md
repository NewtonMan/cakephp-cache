# Cache plugin documentation

## Full-page caching

The simple and fast way. Just cache it "all".
This will not invoke the controller/components even if cache exists.

See [Full-page](Full-page.md) documentation

## Partial view caching

If you want to only cache the rendered template, but still need to invoke middleware/controller/components.

See [Partial](Partial.md) documentation


## Element caching

If you only need a few elements in your view cached.

Use the core build in [element caching](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/views.html#caching-elements).
